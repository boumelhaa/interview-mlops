# MLOps Interview Challenge

This document contains additional challenges to assess your skills in different areas. You can choose which challenges to tackle based on your expertise and interests.

## Level 1: Basic Implementation (Required)
Complete the basic implementation of the `EmbeddingProcessor` class as described in the README.

## Level 2: Code Quality and Error Handling
1. Add comprehensive error handling for:
   - File not found scenarios
   - Invalid data formats
   - Memory constraints
   - Model loading failures
2. Implement proper logging
3. Add type hints and docstrings
4. Write unit tests for your implementation

## Level 3: Performance Optimization
1. Implement batch processing for large datasets
2. Add progress tracking for long-running operations
3. Optimize memory usage when processing large files
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Level 4: Advanced Features
1. Implement parallel processing for embedding generation
2. Add support for different embedding models
3. Implement a feature to compare similarity between items
4. Add data validation and cleaning steps

## Level 5: System Design and Scaling
1. Design a system to process 1 million records:
   - How would you handle memory constraints?
   - How would you implement fault tolerance?
   - How would you monitor the system?
2. Design an API for the embedding service:
   - Define the endpoints
   - Handle rate limiting
   - Implement authentication
3. Design a system to update embeddings when new data arrives:
   - How would you handle incremental updates?
   - How would you maintain consistency?

## Level 6: MLOps Best Practices
1. Implement model versioning
2. Add model performance monitoring
3. Implement A/B testing capability
4. Design a CI/CD pipeline for the embedding service
